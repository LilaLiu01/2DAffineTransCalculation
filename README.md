# Image Affine Transformation and Skew Detection
This Python script uses OpenCV to estimate and decompose affine transformations between two grayscale images, focusing on scale, rotation, shear, and skew effects.

## Features:
* Image Cropping: Loads and crops the central portion of two images for analysis.
* Keypoint Matching: Detects and matches keypoints using ORB and Brute Force matcher.
* Affine Transformation: Estimates the affine transformation matrix and decomposes it into scale, shear, and rotation.
* Skew Calculation: Calculates and outputs the skew effect as a numeric value and percentage.

## Usage:
Replace image_path1 and image_path2 with your image paths
